# PCE predictor
A Colab notebook is available for predicting the power conversion efficiency of small-molecule organic photovoltaics using the models developed in the AEM article.[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)][1]

# Reference
The datasets and models included in this package are part of the article titled "Toward Predicting the Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells via Machine Learning and Improved Descriptors," authored by H. Sahu, W. Rao, A. Troisi, and H. Ma, published in Adv. Energy Mater. 2018, 8, 1801032. You can access the article at [https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.201801032](https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.201801032).
